#### PyBer Business Analysis - Comparing Urban, Suburban and Rural markets

### Introduction
The purpose of our analysis was a deep dive into the total weekly fares for the urban, suburban and rural markets that PyBer serves. We looked at total ride volume, total drivers in the market, the amount of fares they had, the fare charged per ride and the amonunt the driver made per ride. We also investigated what the revenue per market looked like week over week.

### Method

We first combined data about the cities and the rides to get a full picture of how each city was performing. This gives us insight into the cities that use the service most and least in their relative market (urban, suburban, or rural). We totaled that up for each market, as well as got a count of the drivers in each market. We added the total fare revenue from each market, the average fare per ride in each market, and the average fare earned per driver in the market. After we had this information, we broke it out further to look at the fare revenue per week per market for the dates January 1, 2019 to April 28, 2019.

### Findings 

Through January and February, we saw all three markets perform along the same trend lines in fare. The amount earned per market differed, but each line in our graph followed a similar (not identical) path. In March, rural and surburban rides stayed relatively flat (with a slight uptick in rural rides later in March) while there were some spikes and drops in the urban market throughout the month. April showed a flattening of the line for the urban and rural markets, while the suburban market picked up significantly as the month went on. 

### Recommendations

Going forward, we need to look at external factors that may have impacted ride demand. Rainy, snowy, or extremely cold weather can drive residents to choose a PyBer over public transit, personal bicycle or walking. Local events and holiday festivities may make riders choose a PyBer over driving their own car and having to find parking. We also could look further at the utlization of available drivers. Since ride-share drivers are able to make their own schedules, low fares in certain markets may be due to a lack of available drivers. Finally, we need to ensure that cross departmental communication at PyBer is at it's best, so that the efforts of the marketing and public relations departments, driver service and rider servivce can work together to ensure that the right advertising and service/support can be provided to ensure repeat customers and drivers.
